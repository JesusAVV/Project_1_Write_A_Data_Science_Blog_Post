# Project 1: Write A Data Science Blog Post
First project part of Data Scientist Nanodegree Program - Udacity

## About the Project
- Title: Reserve rate of banking companies in national currency in Peru
- Dataset: Data extracted from the statistics portal of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru. Periods from 2010 onwards.
- Site: Medium
- Link: [Reserve rate of banking companies in national currency in Peru](https://medium.com/@jvalenzuelav/reserve-rate-of-banking-companies-in-national-currency-in-peru-12efe1a82a9f)

## Libraries
The libraries that were used were:
- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn
- matplotlib

## Motivation
This is a project that is part of the Data Scientist Nanodegree Program - Udacity.
The development of the solution helps to have a better understanding of what a Data Science project is.

## Files
- Mensuales-20221031-214557.xlsx: Data of the required banking reserve rate from 2010 to the present.
- Mensuales-20221031-214600.xlsx: Data of the effective banking reserve rate from 2010 to the present.
- Project 1 - Write A Data Science Blog Post.ipynb: File with the code in Python language that contains the project solution.

## Summary
- It was evidenced that the banks are complying with the required bank reserve rate and allowing the BCRP to maintain correct monetary control.
- As an expectation of the trend of the effective banking reserve rate, it is expected that it will remain at low levels or, failing that, it will not have significant growth.
